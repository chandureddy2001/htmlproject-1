                             Introduction Paragraph

As a child, I wasn't fond of eating out .My family would eat out at least once a week ,often more than once ,and every time we went anywhere ,but for a little place called Rivne's it was a challenge for my parents .Rivne's was that lucky exception- I loved the place and this made my parents love it too. The place seemed so magical and fascinating to me then, when I was still an elementary school kid ,and  surprisingly, the place still very much fascinates me today .Just recently ,when I visited my old family house for Thanksgiving ,I was surprised and pleased to find out the place still operated and ,in fact ,was still run by the same family. Apart from the house in which I grew up ,Rivne's is probably the dearest place to me in the little town ,just outside of San Ramon ,where I was born and raised .What is so special about the place ? Well, it is hard to answer this question in just a few words.

          Each new rotation gave me more confidence in the churning machine .Every ascent left me elated that i had survived the previous death-defying fall .When another nerve-wracking climb failed to follow the last exhilarating descent and the ride was over ,I know i was hooked .Physically and emotionally drained ,I followed my fellow passengers down the clanging metal steps to reach the safety of my former footing. Had been spared ,but only to have the opportunity to ride again.
